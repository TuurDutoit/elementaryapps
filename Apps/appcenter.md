AppCenter
=========

`AppCenter` is a fast, simple and beautiful software manager for elementary OS. It will be probably be included in the version after `Freya` (currently known as `Freya+1`), but it is still under quite heavy developement.

`AppCenter` consists of two main parts: libappstore and the frontend. `libappstore` is created by a broader group of devs, including the elementary team. This library is powered by `PackageKit`, which manages software cross-distro. It doesn't have a GUI, as it's meant to be controlled by a custom interface; that's where the frontend comes in: it is developed by the elementary team at https://launchpad.net/appcenter and provides a nice elementary interface over the libappstore software manager.
