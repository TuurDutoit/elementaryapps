==============

A list of apps designed for elementary OS.

This is still a work in progress. Pull requests are very welcome!



### Details

* __Name:__ The name of the app.
* __Generic Name:__ The 'type' of the app, like `word processor` or `video player`.
* __Description:__ A short description of what the app does.
* __Developer(s):__ The most important contributor(s) to the project.
* __Link:__ A link to the homepage of the app.
* __PPA:__ The name of the most important PPA containing the app. `None` if the app cannot be installed via a PPA.
* __Executable Name:__ The name of the executable. This is the name you should use while installing the app (or running it from a terminal). Names in *italic* are not sure to be correct.
* __Latest Stable Version:__ Duh-uh
* __Active:__ Whether the app is still kept up to date.


__Note:__ I do not recommend adding unstable ppa's/packages. They may break your system at any time! You have been warned!
