All info on apps designed for elementary OS


### Welcome!

... to the elementary Apps repo. In this repo, I'm collecting all the possible info about apps designed for elementary: find info about the apps on your system, discover new apps, get some inpiration and info before making an app, and much, much more!


###Let's dive in!

The `Comparison.md` file contains a table laying out some data about all the existing apps, like their name, homepage, category, description, ppa url, etc. This file is very useful if your searching for new, awesome apps for your computer. The apps are ordered in 2 categories: `elementary apps` are the apps developed by the elementary team, and `third-party apps` are all the apps developed by outsiders. Applications are ordered alphabetically per category.

In the `Apps` directory, you can find some more info about all the existing apps. Each app has its own file, named accordingly. If you want to read up on a specific app, this directory is the way to go.

In the `Requests` directory, you will find some requests for apps that do not yet exist, one file per request. Those files are more like structured whiteboards, containing any info relevant to the request, like mockups, suggestions for a name, a list of features, description of the workflow, etc. This directory exists for developers to see which applications users want for their systems.


###Contributing

####I want to request an app

If you just have a vague idea, open an issue in the [issue tracker][issues] with the `request` label. Now, the community can give some feedback, request features and discuss the whole thing. When the request has been worked out some more, proceed to the instructions in the next paragraph.

If you know very well how the app should behave, have a mockup, etc., you can make a file in the `Requests` directory (in your own fork, of course) and send me a pull request. I'll be happy to merge it in! Optionally, open a issue in the [issue tracker][issues] with the `request` label.


####I know an existing app that is not yet in the `Apps` directory.

If you have some time and know the app well enough, please make a file for the app in the `Apps` directory (in your own fork, of course). Look at the other files in that directory to get an idea of the markup and the kind of info that is needed. When you're ready, send me a pull request and I'll be very happy to merge it in.

If you don't have time, don't know the app well enough, or just don't want to do the above, simply open an issue in the [issue tracker][issues] with the `add-app` label, already providing as much info as possible; that makes it easier for me. I'll try to add your app as soon as possible to the repo.


####I found a typo somewhere.

I'm not a native English speaker, and I do much of this work on my phone, so I make mistakes.

If you want to correct it for me, do that in your own fork, and send me a pull request. That is the easiest for me, but it probably is quite a hassle for you. If you just open an issue in the [issue tracker][issues] with the `typo` label, that's enough to be my hero :smiley:


####Other questions

For other issues, you can always open an issue in the [issue tracker](issues), or mail me at: [me@tuurdutoit.be](mailto: me@tuurdutoit.be]).


__Enjoy your stay!__
